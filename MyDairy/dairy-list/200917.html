      <p>
        　What method do you use to study? Do you sit at your desk and read incessantly from a reference book or write in a notebook? I believe that a painful method of study is inefficient. Who do you think gets more results, those who love to work on things or those who hate it? First of all, you are definitely a person who enjoys working on it. This is because the human brain is designed to remember fun things clearly. I assure you, if you can't or are not good at learning, it's because of the quality of the people you teach and the materials you use. I consider anything that doesn't make an effort to entertain them to be of poor quality. So if someone has a poor memory, don't blame them. And if you're struggling with poor memory, don't stick with your current method of learning. There has to be a better way. <br>
        　For example, in my case, the way I learn to program is mostly through videos.There are many videos on YouTube that teach you programming, but the best thing about YouTube is that the videos posted are designed to entertain the viewer. For many people, learning on YouTube is probably more fun than learning from a reference book.<br>
        　If you're struggling to learn, find a fun way to learn. I'm sure it's an efficient way to learn.
