        　Recently, I have been asked a lot of questions about my friends' lives. I think that many young people in Japan are probably worried about their future. They say they feel they can't go on like this, but they don't know what to do. And that's as it should be. In Japan, education is so simple that it has an answer and makes you answer to it. There is no education to think about problems that do not have answers. Life is a thing that has no answer. That's why young people are not able to think about life. That's very sad. But we can't change the situation even if we cry about it. I would encourage anyone who is struggling with life to gather information and take action. Some people take my advice and act on it, but many people fail to act and continue to worry. Perhaps those who cannot take action are those who have given up on life. And those who have given up have probably never been successful in their lives. But in order to be successful, you have to act, so if you can't act, you have to give up.<br>
        　Being born in today's Japan is not a blessing in disguise. It would be happier to be born in another developed or developing country. However, if you use that as an excuse, nothing will happen. It is easy to find reasons for not acting. There is no help for those who don't act. Because life is not something to be helped by someone else, but something to be walked on your own. So now I'm struggling, on my own.
