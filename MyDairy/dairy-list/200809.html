      <h1>Let's strength training -August 9, 2020-</h1>
      <p>
        　I enjoyed strength training and went to the gym four or five times a week. But now, due to the new coronavirus, I have to wear a mask at the gym. Wearing a mask while training makes it difficult to breathe. I used to get acid attacks because of this. So I created a training space in my house. I don't go to the gym anymore because I can work out all the muscles in my body.<br>
        　When it comes to strength training, there are many ways to work out depending on your goals. What people often misunderstand is that when you get muscle, your body gets bigger. It's true that if you train stoically and eat a lot, your body will get fat, but that's not something you can do with ordinary effort. If you train in moderation, 2 to 3 times a week, your body will get leaner and thinner. The benefits of strength training aren't just for weight loss. It also improves metabolism and immunity, and is recently said to be most effective against depression. Are you not getting enough exercise? Strength training can only benefit you, so I hope you'll make it a daily habit.
