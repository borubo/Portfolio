      <h1>My resolve -July 28, 2020-</h1>
      <p>
        　In 2012 I graduated from technical college and have been working in manufacturing for 8 years.<br>
        　However, the performance of the manufacturing industry in recent years has been poor and the future is uncertain.
        This year, I decided to become an IT engineer.<br>
        　Japanese manufacturing industry requires a lot of routine work and paperwork, and requires more interaction than necessary. For this reason, I think it's difficult to increase your market value as an engineer because you have to spend a lot of time doing things other than technology.<br>
        　In order to solve these problems, IT skills are essential. That's why I want to develop rational systems and services.<br>
        In the future, I would like to continue learning and practicing to become a person with high market value.
