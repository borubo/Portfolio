        　How do you cope with stress? I'm a nervous person, so I get stressed out over the little things. What a lot of people tend to do is try to forget about the stress. That's what I used to do. But people can't forget what they don't like. Even if people pretend to forget the bad things, they will remember them quickly. So we have no choice but to face the unpleasantness. Don't rely on the power of alcohol or drugs. Whenever I have a bad day, I try to write it down on a piece of paper. I write down a lot of my thoughts about the event and be specific and detailed about what I think about it. I write until there is nothing left to write about, then I think about how to deal with each thing I've written. And by the time I've put it all together, I feel the stress fade away. Our frontal lobe has a function to alleviate stress by being aware of it. This act of writing things down on paper makes use of the frontal lobe. Since I started doing this, I have been able to remember fewer unpleasant things. If you are struggling with many things, please write them down on paper. This method will help you.
