        　Until then, I thought that programming was something very difficult and not something that anyone could do. That's because I had taken a course in C++ at university, and I could not understand it at all. Looking back, the lecturer read the material and said, "You understand, right?" I think the experience was an unfortunate one for me, as I was too lousy to call it a lecture.<br>
        　Actually, I started programming when I read a reference book of Pyson in my company. I enjoyed learning Pyson because I could run the code I wrote right away and the code was small and easy to understand. From there, I became interested in IT and wanted to become a programmer.<br>
        　I'm currently using HTML and CSS to create my own website. My dream is to be involved in the development of applications as a front-end engineer.
