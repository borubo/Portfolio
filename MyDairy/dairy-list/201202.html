        　I'm not familiar with brands such as fashion. Because, in my mind, fashionable and good clothes mean the same thing. Even the best brand of clothes does not look fashionable, depending on the body shape of the person who wears it. On the other hand, even cheap clothes can look good if they are worn by someone with good style. I also believe that the most important thing in clothes is functionality. If I don't feel comfortable, I don't want to wear any nice clothes. Sneakers are better than leather shoes. A shirt is better than a suit.<br>
        　The Japanese are said to be the most fashion-conscious people in the world. Many of us have 20 to 30 outfits per person. Maybe it's because of the four seasons, but it's clearly a lot. And the majority of them are probably not used very often. Maybe it's because they don't fit well or are uncomfortable to wear. If you buy clothes based solely on functionality from the start, you'll be less likely to regret it. What do you look for when choosing clothes?
