      <h1>Familiar Threats -August 24, 2020-</h1>
      <p>
        　What is your impression of China? In recent years, China has grown its economy rapidly. The world's economy can no longer exist without China. It is a very reliable presence, but it is also a threat. It may be fresh in your mind that there have been long-term demonstrations in Hong Kong and Taiwan, mainly by young people. Why is this happening? It's because the Chinese government has a disregard for human life. A famous example of this is the 64 Tiananmen Square incident. The Chinese government has no mercy on people who are against the government. Also, the Chinese government has all the power because the people do not have real suffrage.<br>
        　The threat to the Chinese government is not only to its own citizens. China has invaded the Tibetan region and made it its territory. This is a clear international violation. Now the Chinese government claims India, Bhutan, Taiwan, and even Okinawa in Japan as its own territory. It is said that Indian and Chinese troops have already fought several times. At this rate, China will control all the neighboring countries. This is because China is constantly building up its military. It is currently the third largest military force in the world, but within a few years it will be number one. When that happens, the only thing that will stop China will be the nuclear powers.<br>
        　Many Chinese people are still in exile in other countries, and no one will feel good about the Chinese government. Where do you live now? Do you live in a country that does not possess nuclear weapons? If so, I suggest you flee to another country as soon as possible.
