      　I'm not good at studying. I'm good at math, but not so good at memorization. Programming is written in English, so I wanted to shy away from it because I am not good at English. However, recently, translation applications have evolved, and you can easily read and understand articles about programs because complex sentences can be converted into Japanese with the application. In fact, this article is also written in English with the help of an app called DeepPro.<br>
      　In the last few years, there has been an increase in the number of teaching materials about programming, and you can learn through videos as well as books. I have been using online video courses from sites like dotinstall, Prog-8 and Paiza. All of these sites are excellent and the content is constantly growing so you can continue to learn new technologies. Personally, I would recommend "dotinstall" if you want to learn it not as an educational tool but as a practical one as it has the most amount of material. On the other hand, if you want to learn lightly, I think "Prog-8" is a good choice, as it does not require environment setup. On the other hand, if you want to check your skills, you might want to use Paiza, which has an excellent skill check function.<br>
      　It's only in the last couple of years that such a good educational material has come out, so I think we are in a blessed environment to learn programming now. However, there is currently a huge shortage of programmers. I think that's because there's a lot of resistance to programming. Ten years ago, it would have been very difficult to understand and remember the meaning and role of code one by one. But nowadays, however, programming languages have evolved to be easy to write, so you can easily create a website just by incorporating various modules, even if you don't know the meaning of the code. If you are still uncomfortable with programming after reading this article, why don't you try watching a video or reading a reference book to get a feel for it?
