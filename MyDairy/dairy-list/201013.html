      <h1>Today's Children -October 13, 2020-</h1>
      <p>
        　The other day, UNICEF made the following announcement Japan ranks 37th in child well-being among developed countries (38 countries). Most of the children don't say hello when their friends say hello to them. Most of them have a gloomy look on their faces. Why are the children in Japan so unhappy? I think it's due to the lack of interest in the child by the parents and those around them. When I go out of town, I see a lot of people with their kids and all they do is look at their smart phones. When I see that, it makes me think Why did these people have kids? Smartphones have become a very convenient and indispensable part of our lives. However, I also think that smartphones may take away people's minds. Of course, the worst thing is the parents who don't care about their children. It is very difficult to solve this problem. It is very difficult to solve this problem because it is created by people's values. The Japanese proverb "MITUGONOTAMASHIIHYAKUMADE". This means that a child's character will never change. Modern pedagogy and behavioral economics come to the same conclusion. Therefore, the mentality necessary to become a parent must be taught from childhood. I hope that future parents and school teachers will take their children seriously.
