      <h1>Future and dreams -August 14, 2020-</h1>

        　As Japan is the most aged country in the world, I feel a strong sense of urgency about the future of Japan. The average age of women in Japan is 50 years old. And the population is shrinking by 400,000 every year. Because the birth rate is increasing every year, the population is decreasing at an accelerated rate. If this trend continues, the Japanese will be extinct in 200 years.
        　Japan's population is not the only problem. Japan has poor underground resources and little flat land, which makes it difficult for humans to develop. Modern civilization is supported by electricity, and 90% of the methods of power generation rely on underground resources. In order for Japan to maintain its current society, it is necessary to import underground resources. In order to do so, Japan needs to earn foreign currency. But today Japan is in a state where the means of earning foreign currency are scarce. That's because Japan's main industry is still the automobile. The global demand for automobiles is declining, and the auto industry itself is in decline. In order to earn foreign currency, we need to develop alternatives to the automobile, but unfortunately, we haven't even had a glimpse of that yet. If this trend continues, our standard of living will decline until the Edo period when there is no electricity.
        　There is a 99% chance that Japan will eventually cease to exist. I don't want to share this country's fate. That's why I'm thinking of moving abroad, and I want to move to Northern Europe. In fact, I'm writing this diary in English because English is spoken everywhere in Scandinavia. Yes, my dream is to work as a freelance engineer abroad. My dream is to be someone who can make money anytime, anywhere. Tell us what kind of future you want to be and what kind of person you want to be.<br>
