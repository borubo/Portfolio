      <h1>The allure of cats -October 11, 2020-</h1>
      <p>
        　Do you own a pet? I have one cat in my house. She is very lonely and is always relaxing with someone else. Lately, with the temperature coming down, she has been spending more time indoors. She used to sleep on the floor, but now she comes under the covers. She's a very cute cat, but she's also a nuisance. That's because when I try to sleep on the futon, she is used first. I don't feel comfortable waking her up, so I have to be patient. Despite these disadvantages, I still think it's a good thing to have a cat as a pet. Because they have the power to heal people's hearts. There was a time when my father and mother didn't get along well with each other, and they were about to divorce. But after we adopted a cat, my father and mother made up with each other. I think this was something that only she could have done. If you are ever hurt, I would recommend you to try touching a cat. They will help you heal.
