      <h1>My Regrets -August 12, 2020-</h1>
      <p>
        　What do you think of your life so far? I actually very much regret the way I've been living my life. That's because I entered a technical college with high tuition fees, and I've been involved in industry since I entered the workforce.<br>
        　As I wrote in my earlier diary, manufacturing in Japan is full of unnecessary jobs. Also, we are behind in IT and do all of our inventory and financial management in Excel. Moreover, they do not use macros in Excel, but instead use manual input and visual checks. From a foreign company's point of view, this must seem outdated. How did it come to this? This is probably because Japanese society has a tradition of valuing hierarchical relationships. Younger workers in Japanese companies have very little discretionary power and have no choice but to do what their elders tell them to do. However, the older a person gets, the less likely he or she is to be able to do something new. That is why I think that if older people take the lead, technology will stagnate.<br>
        　On the other hand, in the field of IT, technology is advancing so fast that we need to keep acquiring new technology. We can't survive if we're not doing things in a useless or inefficient way. Sometimes I wish I could tell my high school self these things. What do you think of your life and the society you live in today?
