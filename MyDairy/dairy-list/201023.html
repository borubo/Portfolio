        　Have you ever wished you could go back in time? I've recently developed a strong desire to go back in time. That's because I realize that I'm not young anymore, and in the IT industry, I'm mostly young in my 20s, and in my 30s I'm already old. This is a handicap in finding a job. If I could go back in 10 years, I would not be working in manufacturing.<br>
        　I lived in my hometown until I was 18 years old. I'm from a rural area with nothing but mountains and fields. When I was a student, there was no word for IT and no internet. Naturally, none of my classmates wanted to be a programmer. When I was choosing a profession, programmer was not an option that came to mind; I could have learned a lot about manufacturing and social trends in my 20s. My biggest regret is that I didn't gather information and act on it.<br>
        　Now I'm focused on acting and gathering information. I know it's late, but I believe now is the last time to start my life over. If I give up, my life will go that way. That's how I spend my days.
