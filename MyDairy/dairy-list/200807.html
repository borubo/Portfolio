      <h1>My diet -August 7, 2020-</h1>
      <p>
        　I was actually very fat when I was a student. I was quite busy in college because I was doing club activities and writing papers until late at night. Because of that, I was eating four meals a day, which was a haphazard way of life for me. I'm 170cm tall, but I weighed 76kg when I was a university student. Now I'm 64kg.<br>
        　What I did as a diet is to restrict my diet and run every day. More than 60% of the human body's energy is used to digest food. So by eating less, you can use that energy for your metabolism and lose weight. The key here is not to eliminate food, but to reduce it. If you completely cut out food, the human body will consume muscle before fat, which can lead to rebounding. I would suggest eating one meal a day or fasting one or two days a week. Of course, avoid high-calorie, high-fat foods at this time. Also, it's important to drink plenty of water. It is recommended to drink at least 2 liters of water every day to eliminate a lot of waste. Running was also done not to burn calories, but to boost metabolism. It's still important to sweat it out. Alternating saunas and water baths are also recommended as they can boost your metabolism.<br>
        　It's important to look good. In some companies, just because you are obese, you are considered to have no self-control skills and may not be able to get ahead. If you want to become a better version of yourself, you should start by building a better body.
